# Individual Household Electric Power Consumption

## Data

The data is taken from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption

7 timeseries of electricity consumption from a household in France are observed for about 4 years, from December 2006 to November 2010. Measurements are made every minute.

The timeseries variables are:

- `Global_active_power`
- `Global_reactive_power`
- `Voltage`
- `Global_intensity`
- `Sub_metering_1`
- `Sub_metering_2`
- `Sub_metering_3`
